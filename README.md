## Dragonsweeper

This is a standalone version of the minigame that players encounter at the end of Goldmine.

This version of Dragonsweeper (React/JavaScript) is now deprecated. For the new version (Solid/Typescript) go [here](https://github.com/Alaricus/dragonsweeper-solid-ts).

You can play the updated version (see the link above) on its [itch.io](https://mortarman.itch.io/dragonsweeper) page.
